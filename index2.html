                        <h2>Lexus</h2>
                        <p>Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota. The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. It has ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value. Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas, United States.<br><br>

                        Created at around the same time as Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan created their Acura and Infiniti luxury divisions respectively, Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.<br><br>
                        
                        Lexus vehicles are largely produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and Kyūshū regions, and in particular at Toyota's Tahara, Aichi, Chūbu and Miyata, Fukuoka, Kyūshū plants. Assembly of the first Lexus produced outside the country, the Canadian-built RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus began operating its own design, engineering and manufacturing centers.<br><br>
                        
                        Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market, the United States. The division inaugurated dealerships in the Japanese domestic market in 2005, becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin. The brand has since debuted in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe and other regions, and has introduced hybrid vehicles in many markets.<br><br>
                    Lexus is the luxury vehicle brand of Toyota Motor.
                    Lexus was first introduced in 1989 in the United States and is now sold in more than 70 countries. 
                    Lexus ranks as the fourth largest luxury brand and more than one million vehicles behind third-ranked Audi (Mercedes, Audi and BMW are all tightly bunched). 
                    Global volume for Lexus was up 4.9% in 2018 to 701,000 cars sold. It marks a turnaround from 2017 when sales fell after four straight years of records for the brand. The U.S. is the biggest market with 42% of unit sales, but China, Japan and Taiwan were the fastest growing markets, all at more than 20% growth. 
                    Lexus vehicles were deemed the most dependable new cars the past eight years in the annual study conducted by J.D. Power & Associates.
